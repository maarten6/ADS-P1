# Structure - FVA
- This folder contains the source code of the online algorithm.
- This folder also contains the "TestInstances" folder which contains the folders "Offline" and "Online" and they contain the test instances provided to us and used in the paper. The "TestInstances" folder also contains the "Generated" folder that also has "Offline" and "Online". But these have explicit readmes (and are filled when a specific mode is run in the code).
- Finally, it contains the "OfflineAlgorithm" folder that contains the source code of both ILP solvers, as well as additional extra scripts as explained in the readme within that folder.
